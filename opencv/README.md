# OpenCV samples

Following the lines of *Learning OpenCV 3* by A. Kaehler and G. Bradski 
(First Edition).

Contents:
- The `samples` directory contains examples from the book (more or less modified)
- The `sandbox` directory contains some very small tests. 

Note for myself: `samples/example-2-5.cpp`
