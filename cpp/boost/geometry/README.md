# Boost Geometry sandbox tests

## Difference.cpp

In this program the `boost::geometry::difference` method is tested and the
results are plotted using the boost geometry svg utility.

## Union.cpp

In this program the `boost::geometry::union_` method is tested and the
results are plotted using the boost geometry svg utility.

## Point.hpp and Point.cpp

In this files, we test how we can inherits from boost geometry objects and
define traits for these new objects. Focus is on points traits.


## TemplatedConversion.cpp

Testing the templated conversion method with boost geometry object
