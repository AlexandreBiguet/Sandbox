# Benchmarks

During the construction of snmpp library, I may need to do some benchmarks. 
They are here. 
 
For the moment I only used the very simple Benchmark tool in 
`src/snmpp/Benchmark` but two benchmarks libs could be used if necessary: 

* https://github.com/google/benchmark
* https://github.com/nickbruun/hayai along with 
  https://bruun.co/2012/02/07/easy-cpp-benchmarking

## Notes
* The `data` directory contains the outputs of the different benchmarks. 
* Each benchmark file must contain an explanation of what is being 
benchmarked.
